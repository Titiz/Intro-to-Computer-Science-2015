Main.py is the main file of the program that should be run
eztext is a module for pygame that allows for typing directly on the screen (http://www.pygame.org/project-EzText-920-.html)
A custom font was used for this game (might not work without it). The font can be downloaded here: http://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font
Controls - W  to jump, A and D for x-direction movement and space bar to fire meal swipes.
There are 14 meal swipes to 'distract' RAs, (talkative RA's require 2 swipes to 'distract')
Game is lost when one gets a suspision level of 100% or falls off the highline
Game is won when the player reaches the end
The score is calculated by time taken * (meal swipes left * 0.1 + 1) - suspision * 10
May the force be with you!
Have fun!

PS The occasional flying RA is not a bug. It's a premium feature :).
